        <p>I have been working as a developer for about three years. It wasn't until 2019 that <br/>

        <p>
          I would be a great fit for any web development team because of my lengthy history in programming, mathematics, and logical thinking.<br/>
          I have gained my skills from four years of college learning, attending Lambda School's full stack web development team, as well as <br/>
          all outside learning. I am passionate about sharing my ideas, learning from others, and creating a respectful work environment.  <br/>
